    # The faces are 36x36 pixels, which works fine as a template size. You could
    # add other fields to this struct if you want to modify HoG default
    # parameters such as the number of orientations, but that does not help
    # performance in our limited test.
    feature_params = {'template_size': 36,
                      'hog_cell_size': 3}

    ## Step 1. Load positive training crops and random negative examples
    # YOU CODE 'get_positive_features' and 'get_random_negative_features'
    features_pos = get_positive_features(train_path_pos, feature_params)
    # higher will work strictly better, but your should start with 10000
    num_negative_examples = 50000
    features_neg, neg_examples = get_random_negative_features(non_face_scn_path, feature_params, num_negative_examples)

    ## Step 2. Train classifier
    features_total = np.concatenate([features_pos,features_neg], axis=0)
    labels = np.concatenate([np.ones((features_pos.shape[0], 1)), -np.ones((features_neg.shape[0], 1))],
                            axis=0)

    model = svm_classify(features_total, labels, C=0.1, max_iter=1000, tol=1e-4)

    ## Step 3. Examine learned classifier
    # You don't need to modify anything in this section. The section first
    # evaluates _training_ error, which isn't ultimately what we care about,
    # but it is a good sanity check. Your training error should be very low.
    print('Initial classifier performance on train data:')
    confidences = model.decision_function(features_total)
    label_vector = labels
    tp_rate, fp_rate, tn_rate, fn_rate = report_accuracy(confidences, label_vector)


    # Visualize how well separated the positive and negative examples are at
    # training time. Sometimes this can idenfity odd biases in your training
    # data, especially if you're trying hard negative mining. This
    # visualization won't be very meaningful with the placeholder starter code.
    non_face_confs = confidences[label_vector.ravel()<0]
    face_confs = confidences[label_vector.ravel()>0]
    fig2 = plt.figure(2)
    plt.hold(True)
    plt.plot(np.arange(non_face_confs.size), np.sort(non_face_confs), color='g')
    plt.plot(np.arange(face_confs.size), np.sort(face_confs), color='r')
    plt.plot([0, non_face_confs.size], [0,0], color='b')
    plt.hold(False)

    ## Step 4. (optional) Mine hard negatives
    # Mining hard negatives is extra credit. You can get very good performance 
    # by using random negatives, so hard negative mining is somewhat
    # unnecessary for face detection. If you implement hard negative mining,
    # you probably want to modify 'run_detector', run the detector on the
    # images in 'non_face_scn_path', and keep all of the features above some
    # confidence level.

    # hard negative mining

    # hard positive mining

    # training with hard examples

    # estimate again after hard example mining

    # visualize

    ## Step 5. Run detector on test set.
    # YOU CODE 'run_detector'. Make sure the outputs are properly structured!
    # They will be interpreted in Step 6 to evaluate and visualize your
    # results. See run_detector.m for more details.

    bboxes, confidences, image_ids = run_detector(
        test_scn_path, model, feature_params, threshold=0.5, step_size=1, downsample=0.95)

    # run_detector will have (at least) two parameters which can heavily
    # influence performance -- how much to rescale each step of your multiscale
    # detector, and the threshold for a detection. If your recall rate is low
    # and your detector still has high precision at its highest recall point,
    # you can improve your average precision by reducing the threshold for a
    # positive detection.


    ## Step 6. Evaluate and Visualize detections
    # These functions require ground truth annotations, and thus can only be
    # run on the CMU+MIT face test set. Use visualize_detectoins_by_image_no_gt
    # for testing on extra images (it is commented out below).

    # Don't modify anything in 'evaluate_detections'
    gt_ids, gt_bboxes, gt_isclaimed, tp, fp, duplicate_detections = \
        evaluate_detections(bboxes, confidences, image_ids, label_path, fig_path)

    visualize_detections_by_image(bboxes, confidences, image_ids, tp, fp, test_scn_path, label_path, fig_path)

    # performance to aim for
    # random (stater code) 0.001 AP
    # single scale ~ 0.2 to 0.4 AP
    # multiscale, 6 pixel step ~ 0.83 AP
    # multiscale, 4 pixel step ~ 0.89 AP
    # multiscale, 3 pixel step ~ 0.92 AP

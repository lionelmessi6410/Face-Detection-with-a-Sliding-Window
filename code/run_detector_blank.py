    """
    FUNC: This function returns detections on all of the images in a given path.
        You will want to use non-maximum suppression on your detections or your
        performance will be poor (the evaluation counts a duplicate detection as
        wrong). The non-maximum suppression is done on a per-image basis. The
        starter code includes a call to a provided non-max suppression function.
    ARG:
        - test_scn_path: a string; This directory contains images which may or
                        may not have faces in them. This function should work for
                        the MIT+CMU test set but also for any other images.
        - model: the linear classifier model
        - feature_params: a dict; 'template_size': the number of pixels spanned
                        by each train / test template (probably 36).
                        'hog_cell_size': the number of pixels in each HoG cell
                        (default 6).
                        Template size should be evenly divisible by hog_cell_size.
                        Smaller HoG cell sizes tend to work better, but they make
                        things slower because the feature dimensionality increases
                        and more importantly the step size of the classifier
                        decreases at test time.
    RET:
        - bboxes: (N, 4) ndarray; N is the number of non-overlapping detections, bboxes[i, :] is
                        [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] for detection i.
        - confidences: (N, 1) ndarray; confidences[i, :] is the real valued confidence
                        of detection i.
        - image_ids: (N, 1) ndarray;  image_ids[i, :] is the image file name for detection i.
    """
    # The placeholder version of this code will return random bounding boxes in
    # each test image. It will even do non-maximum suppression on the random
    # bounding boxes to give you an example of how to call the function.

    # Your actual code should convert each test image to HoG feature space with
    # a _single_ call to vl_hog for each scale. Then step over the HoG cells,
    # taking groups of cells that are the same size as your learned template,
    # and classifying them. If the classification is above some confidence,
    # keep the detection and then pass all the detections for an image to
    # non-maximum suppression. For your initial debugging, you can operate only
    # at a single scale and you can skip calling non-maximum suppression.
